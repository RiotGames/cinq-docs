Submitting changes

*   Please write clear and useful commit messages. Here are three blog posts on how to do it right:

  * `Writing Git commit messages <http://365git.tumblr.com/post/3308646748/writing-git-commit-messages>`_
  * `A Note About Git Commit Messages <http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html>`_
  * `On commit messages <http://who-t.blogspot.ch/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html>`_

*   We would prefer one branch per feature or fix; please keep branches small and on topic.

*   Send a pull request to the ``develop`` branch. See the GitHub `pull request docs <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ for further information.
